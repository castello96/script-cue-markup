* Need to update tests
* select and delete annotations
* Fool proof design
* Should I prevent adding a cue on top of a previous one? Probably...within what threshold of another should I prevent it
* Undo button
* Redo Button
* Implement key shortcuts
    * cmd + s
    * cmd + z
    * cmd + shift + z
    * arrow left and right keys for page navigation
    * delete key for deletions
* Implement progress bar for export
* Line up the "page x of x" under the middle column
* Move application config to a json file and read into an object
* Add a horizontal line that follows the mouse in markup mode
* Allow user to choose color preferences

VALIDATION
* validate edit annotation coordinates are within page bounds

NICE TO HAVE
* Highlight the annotation on the page when selected from the annotation editor

EDGE CASES
* What happens when we have begun marking up a pdf and then load in a markup file
* What happens when you load a markup with more pages than the currently open PDF?
