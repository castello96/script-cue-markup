NEED BEFORE BETA RELEASE
* Need to update tests
* Fool proof design
    * Dont show select, add cue, or annotate until there is a pdf
    * dont show delete until a cue is selected
    * dont show prev and next until there is a pdf
    * dont show cue add cue type frame until there is a pdf
    * dont show view frame until there are cues present / a markup loaded
* Should I prevent adding a cue on top of a previous one? Probably...within what threshold of another should I prevent it
* Wrap annotation text so it doesnt run on 
* Deselect cue once it is deleted
* validate file chooser type
* Address TODOS in code

VALIDATION
* validate edit annotation coordinates are within page bounds

NICE TO HAVE
* Undo button
* Redo Button
* Implement key shortcuts
    * cmd + s
    * cmd + z
    * cmd + shift + z
    * arrow left and right keys for page navigation
    * delete key for deletions
* Implement progress bar for export
* Line up the "page x of x" under the middle column
* Move application config to a json file and read into an object
* Add a horizontal line that follows the mouse in markup mode
* Allow user to choose color preferences
* Highlight the annotation on the page when selected from the annotation editor

EDGE CASES
* What happens when we have begun marking up a pdf and then load in a markup file
* What happens when you load a markup with more pages than the currently open PDF?
