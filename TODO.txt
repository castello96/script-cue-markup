* Make it so that you can toggle between select mode and markup mode
    * In select mode you can click on a cue to select it or in between cues to deselect
    * In markup mode you can add cues anywhere
    * This means a refactor of infer_click_intent. Probably not needed anymore
* Add a horizontal line that follows the mouse in markup mode
* Add annotations to cues
* Should I prevent adding a cue on top of a previous one? Probably...within what threshold of another should I prevent it
* Fool proof design
* Allow Qlab cues to be added



NEXT:
* Page offset work
    * Looking pretty good but need to be able to load the "negative" page numbers
