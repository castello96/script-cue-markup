* Make it so that you can toggle between select mode and markup mode
    * In select mode you can click on a cue to select it or in between cues to deselect
    * In markup mode you can add cues anywhere
    * This means a refactor of infer_click_intent. Probably not needed anymore
* Add a horizontal line that follows the mouse in markup mode
