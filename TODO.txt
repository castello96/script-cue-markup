* Make it so that you can toggle between select mode and markup mode
    * In select mode you can click on a cue to select it or in between cues to deselect
    * In markup mode you can add cues anywhere
* Add a horizontal line that follows the mouse in markup mode
* Add annotations to cues
* Should I prevent adding a cue on top of a previous one? Probably...within what threshold of another should I prevent it
* Fool proof design
* Allow Qlab cues to be added
* Allow user to go to page by selecting in listbox
* Implement key shortcuts
* Render listbox pages in order
* Move all the load, save, save as, export functions to a menu
* Implement save
* Implement progress bar for export
